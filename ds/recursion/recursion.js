 *  Recursion
 *   -> it is a programming and mathmatical concept
 *  what is recurrsion ?
 *  Recurrsion is the technique using which we solve bigger problem by calculating the answer of
 * smaller sub problems. we generally denote the bigger problem as a function and same arguments
 * and then call the same function with diff argument denoting smaller sub problems . so we can get the
 * ans of smaller sub problem  and build the answer for bigger problem.
