 1. What is hot and live reloading in react native ? 
 Ans : 
 Live Reloading and Hot Reloading are two different mechanisms in React Native that help developers during 
 the development process by updating the app's code without requiring a full restart. While they serve a
 similar purpose, there are key differences between the two:

1. **Live Reloading:**
   - Live Reloading reloads the entire app whenever you save changes to your code, including both 
     JavaScript and native code changes.
   - When you make code changes and save them, the app's state is reset, and the app restarts from the
     initial screen. Any unsaved data or user interactions are lost during the reload.
   - Live Reloading is useful for quickly seeing the changes you made to the app without manually 
     stopping and re-running the development server.

2. **Hot Reloading:**
   - Hot Reloading allows you to update the JavaScript code of your app on the fly, without losing the
     current app state.
   - When you make code changes and save them, the modified JavaScript code is injected into the
     running app, and the app's state is preserved. This means that you can see the changes in the UI
     without losing the current screen or losing data entered by the user.
   - Hot Reloading is more efficient and faster than Live Reloading, as it only updates the modified 
     JavaScript code, not the entire app.

In summary, Live Reloading restarts the app from scratch and resets the state, while Hot Reloading
   injects the updated JavaScript code into the running app without losing the state. Hot Reloading 
   is generally the preferred choice for React Native development, as it allows for a faster development
   workflow and a more seamless user experience during development. However, there may be situations where
   Live Reloading is necessary, especially when making changes to native code, as Hot Reloading
   only works for JavaScript code changes.

2. How many threads run in React Native?
   There are two threads run in React Native:
    -JavaScript thread
    -Main UI thread

3. Differentiate between the React component and the React element.
   React component is a class or function that accepts input and returns a React element while React 
   element displays the look of React Component Instance to be created.
