//1.  Design UI only using HTML, CSS, JS using specific functions only. (Who asks like this. There are multiple ways to design the functionality).
// 2. What is new in ES6? Seriously is this is a question prepare for
// 3. Some I/O questions 4. Some qs on Closure, currying.
// 4. Explain javascript prototypes
// 5. implement a design in any language/SDK you prefer (ideally vuejs/react) - nothing crazy, json data in a table, couple of pages, mostly focused on following design, writing clean code and having tests. A lot of things are left open or unclear to see how you handle them - talk with EM + senior dev - talk with team
